# Harvard-CS50

## Brief

CS50 was the first CS course i learn when i go to the university, the professor is really enthusiastic and the course was like the little window let me look through it and see the world of computer science.

Unfortunately i didn't make any records or whatever, so i want to briefly go thorough the lecture videos and notes, and finish the lab and homework, it was pretty fun i must say
